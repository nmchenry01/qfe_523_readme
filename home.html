        <ul>
            <li>In order to retrieve data, first select an investable universe. The universes are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>US Equities ([IYH,IYF,IYK,IYW] = [Healthcare, Financials, Consumer Goods, Technology])</li>
                    <li>International Equities ([EWG,EWU,EWJ,FXI] = [Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, China])</li>
                    <li>Foreign Exchange ([FXB,FXCH,FXE,FXY] = [British Pound, Chinese Yuan, Euro, Japanese Yen])</li>
                    <li>Commodities ([IAU,SLV,VEGI,FILL] = [Gold, Silver, Agriculture, Energy])</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If an incorrect date range is entered, the application will display an error. For example, if the date range
                is inverted an error will appear. Also, if monthly rebalancing frequency is chosen then the date interval
                will be limited to between 4 months and 2 years worth of data. Similarly, quarterly rebalancing is limited
                to within 1 year and 4 years and biannual rebalancing is limited to within 2 years and 8 years</li>
            <li>Transaction costs can be included by indicting "Yes" or "No" in the drop down menu</li>
            <li>Currently, the objective function is limited to the Sharpe Ratio. Additional objective functions may be added
                in the future</li>
            <li>Rebalancing frequency options are "Monthly", "Quarterly", or "Biannually". This will adjust how often the optimization
                function runs to reallocate the portfolio</li>
            <li>The benchmarks included in this application are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>SP500 (IVV)</li>
                    <li>International Equity (EFA)</li>
                    <li>US 10 Year Treasury (IEF)</li>
                    <li>Commodities (GSG)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To run the application, you are required to enter a date interval. See several bullet points above for valid
                date ranges</li>
            <li>The data depicted in this application is derived from log returns based upon daily adjusted closing prices taken
                from Quandl, specifically the EOD database. For example, a date range of 9/1/2017 through 11/3/2017 uses
                the daily adjusted closing price on 10/31/2017 as a base to compute the daily log return on 9/1/2017</li>
            <li>For a complete list of securities available via this application, see the EOD database description on the
                <a href="https://www.quandl.com/data/EOD-End-of-Day-US-Stock-Prices" target="_blank">Quandl website</a>
            </li>
            <li>If a starting or ending date is a market closure, the prior available trading day is used as a substitute. Days
                that the market is closed are ignored by this applicaiton</li>
            <li>When computing monthly returns, the calendar month associated with the starting and ending dates is used. For
                example, a date range of 9/1/2017 through 11/3/2017 would generate a holding period from the last trading
                day of October 2017 through the last trading day of November 2017</li>
            <li>When computing weekly returns, the last trading day of the calendar week in which the starting and ending dates
                fall is used. For example, a starting date of 10/5/2017 and ending date of 11/16/2017 would use the 10/6/2017
                and 11/16/2017 adjusted closing prices</li>
            <li>Because of the date rounding associated with weekly and monthly returns, slight differences in culumaltive returns
                over a period will be noticable. For the most cumulative returns over a period, see the daily cumulative
                returns entry in the summary statistics table</li>
